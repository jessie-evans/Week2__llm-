Transformer models are a type of neural network architecture introduced in 2017, widely used in natural language processing (NLP) tasks. 
They are particularly known for their attention mechanisms, which allow the model to weigh the importance of different words in the input sequence when processing each word. 
This parallel processing capability makes them highly efficient for training on large datasets compared to previous architectures like RNNs. 
Examples include GPT, BERT, and T5.
